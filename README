YUI DOC
=======


yuidoc is a set of tools to generate the API documentation for the JavaScript
in the YUI library.  The docs are derived completely from JavaDoc style
comment blocks; no attempt is made to understand the javascript itself.

yuidoc requires Python 2.3+ with the following extensions:
    simplejson - for reading and writing json
    cheetah    - for generating the html docs
    pygments   - for colorizing the source

The code for yuidoc is provided under a
`BSD license <http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/license.html>`_
