Installation:
=============

Unix (including cygwin):
------------------------

        which easy_install

   If it returns something, it's installed skip to step #3.


2.  Install Setup Tools:

    Download easy_install installer and executed it

        wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
        sudo python ez_setup.py

3.  Install yuidoc using easy_install::

        easy_install easy-yuidoc


DOS/Windows:

    Use Python 2.4.3 as 2.5 generates warnings because the json parser has
    not been updated yet::

    You need to add ``C:\\python24`` and ``C:\\python24\\Scripts`` to your path.

    and executed it (double click on it).

    to ``C:\\Python24\\Libsite-packages\\Cheetah``



.. note::

    This tool will generally work with code that has been commented for
    jsdoc, with one exception:  you must have at least one @module block defined
    somewhere in your source.  If you don't, the program will run but won't
    generate anything.
